This project requires an HTC Vive.

UpArrow - increases the haptic strength
DownArrow - decreases haptic strength

RightArrow - increase brightness
LeftArrow - decrease brightness

Enter - Toggles between original scene and the one I just added.

New scene runs slightly faster than the target speed of 40 Hz. Due to the 90 fps nature of the Vive it runs at 45 Hz.
